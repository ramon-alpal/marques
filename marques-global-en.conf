# marques.conf - global CONFiguration file for the script 'marquÃ¨s'
# (MARKS of files of all kinds and of actions of all kinds).
#
# In this file are ignored the empty lines or the ones that began
# with a hashtag '#'; and the configuration is at 2 levels of elements
# and values:
# 1) Each element is a mark that is represented with one line;
# 2) Each element is divided in 3 values separated between them with
#   one or multiple tabulations and/or spaces characters. Also you have to
#   keep in mind that the tabulations will be converted into spaces at the
#   end, these limits the values to not have spaces, which for example
#   prohibits having routs and file names with spaces. Nevertheless
#   you could correct the issue changing the separator character of
#   the program for another one, like for example greater than '>'. The
#   functionality of the 3 values is defined at the next section.
#
# VALUES:
# Name: The name of the mark.
#
# Type, the type of the file and action between:
# - c, *Copy* the file, specially useful for licenses;
# - d, open the *Directory*;
# - f, open the *File*;
# - m, (*Meta* copy) copy all the files inside a directory;
# - t, open and copy the file, specially useful for *Templates*;
# - x, copy the contents of the file to the *X11's* clipboard.
#
# Route: the complete route to the file with the possibility of using
# variables, tildes '~' or any other kind of shell-script expansion.
